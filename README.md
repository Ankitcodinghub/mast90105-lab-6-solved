b. Use the command rnorm(n,mean,sd) in R to generate a sample of size n = 100, Y1,…,Y100, from this distribution. Use the command mean() to compute the sample mean and standardized second moment:

.

c. Estimate the mean and variance of Y¯ and Y¯S2 from the data Y¯1,…,Y¯1000, and Y¯S,21,…,Y¯S,21000. How close are these estimates to theoretical values?

d. Standardize the sample means and sample second moments, Y¯1,…,Y¯1000, and Y¯S,21,…,Y¯S,21000, so that they have zero mean and unit variance. Use the command hist() to construct the histograms of the standardized data. What distribution do the histograms resemble? What are the exact distributions?

2. We would like to generate a random variable X which has the following cdf:



0,



1, x &lt; 0, 0 ≤ x &lt; 1, x ≥ 1.

a. Use runif(x) function in R to generate random numbers from the uniform U(0,1) distribution and write a function that generates random numbers from the cdf F(x).

b. Use this function to generate a sample of size 1000 from this distribution and use this sample to estimate Pr(0.6 &lt; X &lt; 0.8). Compute the exact probability. How close is the estimated probability to the exact one?

c. Use the generated sample to construct the histogram of this distribution. Comment on the shape of the histogram.
